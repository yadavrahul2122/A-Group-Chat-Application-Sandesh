# A-Group-Chat-Application-Sandesh
## **A Group Chat Application named 'Sandesh' based on Socket Programming in Java Language using Client and Server protocol.**

### Introduction
Since the introduction of first-gen consumer messaging apps like AIM in the 1990s, chat has solidified its role as a mainstream method of communication. In many situations, users choose chat or instant messaging apps over other ways of contacting each other. Chat’s asynchronous nature eliminates the urgency and pressure of a phone call, but it still feels faster, more immediate, and less formal than email. Communication in our application follows the client-server approach. The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions task or workload between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. 

In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. In terms of programming, Socket concept is used to implement the code. Socket programming in Java is used for communication between the applications that are running on different JRE. It can be either connection-oriented or connectionless. On the whole, a socket is a way to establish a connection between a client and a server.
